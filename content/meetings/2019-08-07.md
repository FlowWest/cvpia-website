## Update on model modification proposal for Managed Wetland Trophic Subsidies (rice field food) (Brett)
* Review of conceptual mixing rate of food sources into mainstream river segments.
* Built a mixing model.
* Question: how fast does mixing occur?
* Example: Knights Landing mixing observable on Google Earth
* Errors came down to visual errors on documenting full-mixing.
* Back calculated from full mixing to food mixing
* Russ Perry bio-physical model based on hatchery growth rates / temperature / rations
* Nags data + suisun growth rates. Also cage fish measurements upstream / down stream of sources.
* Finding density that represents saturation ration.  
* Should be able to assign higher growth rates
* Question: what about saturation level through time? Is there a relationship between number of fish and removal of food because of consumption?
* Assume dilution is primary driver
* What about good holding habitat?
* Don’t consider thalweg to be good habitat for holding salmon
* Need to assume food directed at margins
* Would it make sense to expand from linear distance?
* Proxy estimate good for now. Some rivers would have more definition.
* Assuming mixing is linear, but really more complex mixing.
* Intention to develop initial operation, then expand to other streams as appropriate.
* Acres flooded to numbers of fish affected. Could result in changed growth rates or different growth matrices. Initial results are greater than current Perry estimates.
* Question: why not just implement Rene’s idea out of the box?
* Will follow-up off line
 
## Status of Science Coordinator (Cesar)
* No significant update from last call.
* Announcement sometime in August
 
## Discuss where we are now and where we are going
* Review slides from draft implementation plan cross-walked with current status
* Presentation Slides
* Near Term 5 Year Restoration Strategy
* Schedules and updates reflected in slides
* SIT likely to meet less often
* Science coordinator outreach and review in year 4 of 5
* Benchmark schedule from 2017. Now pushing things back
* Contracting issues delayed watershed meetings and participation by Adam and Jim
* Revised timelines
* Would be helpful to have interim science coordinator to write up tech memo
* Would like to continue to develop subgroups to consider habitat decay stuff
* Would be nice to continue to develop time per unit effort to justify strategy rates
* Relationship to Salmon Partnership and CAMP? When would these be done?
* Assume we will be talking about acreage increases across habitat types.
* When would we need something? Probably October of this year after AFS meeting
* Who is keeping track of the monitoring in order to answer questions
* Working on draft data guidance. Lots of data is stovepiped. Looking to organize the  monitoring team. 
* How will we correlate and coordinate data
* Develop broad agreements about monitoring reviews
 
## A quick review of the Near-term Restoration Strategy development (Jim and Adam)
 
## CPAR and the Strategy: How are they related? (Cesar, Heather, and Rod)
* Reclamation has been meeting with Commissioner regarding CPAR
* Assumption that CPAR list will be updated to replace outdated projects with current pri##Using the DSMs to develop the strategy (Jim and Adam)
 
## Status of the Chinook and O. mykiss DSMs (Jim and Adam)
* How to efficiently develop calibration?
* Coordination with FlowWest to talk
 
## Status of watershed expert meetings (Mike U.)
* September 9 in Lodi
* Red Bluff and Sacramento dates pending
* Modeling 101 still under development
 
## Status of the habitat decay proposal (Rod)
* Everyone has been on leave, nothing to report
 
## The role of the SIT after the Near-term Restoration Strategy (Cesar, Heather, and Rod)
 
## New Business
* Draft Data Guidance should be available soon
* Expert elicitation could include customers / stakeholders. What level of detail would be appropriate
* See cvpia.scienceintegrationteam.com
* Notes from chat:

The Role of the Sit after NTRS Monitoring direction - improvements - data gaps Feedback loop - Hindcast completion and monitoring of recent projects Incorporate new sub-models - e.g. Habitat Decay; Rice Field Food; etc. Revisit - Revise DSMs Peer Review Revisions to NTRS - Schedule & Purposes - what needs fixing/modification first?

From Rod Wittler to Everyone: (10:43 AM)
CPAR and the Strategy: Evaluate remaining 81 CPAR actions in context of NTRS Replace CPAR actions with NTRS actions by EOY 2019

From Rod Wittler to Everyone: (10:54 AM)
3 sets of charters/projects to collect feedback from: Those in the pipeline already (thru FY19) Historical (Hindcast) 2020 and beyond - those generated by the NTRS

From Sadie to Everyone: (10:57 AM)
