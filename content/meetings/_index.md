## Welcome

The primary focus of the project is to identify potential data, compile and provide access to appropriate data, and develop analytical models consistent with CVPIA fish doubling goals within the framework of Structured Decision Making. This effort will be coordinated and revised with the resource agencies and stakeholders. It is anticipated that agency and stakeholder representatives will provide the majority of the biological expertise and institutional knowledge.

Biological expertise and institutional knowledge is transferred to the SDM process through a series of regularly-scheduled conference calls and in-person meetings. Records of previous meetings are available for review.
