## Welcome

The primary focus of the project is to identify potential data, compile and provide access to appropriate data, and develop analytical models consistent with CVPIA fish doubling goals within the framework of Structured Decision Making. This effort will be coordinated and revised with the resource agencies and stakeholders. It is anticipated that agency and stakeholder representatives will provide the majority of the biological expertise and institutional knowledge.

Biological expertise and institutional knowledge is transferred to the SDM process through a series of regularly-scheduled conference calls and in-person meetings. Records of previous meetings are available for review.

#### Agenda   
* 10:00 Welcome/Agenda Review (Megan Cook)  
* 10:05 SIT Structured Decision-Making Direction for the remainder of the year (Jim Peterson, Adam Duarte)  
* 10:25 NTRS Info Needs Gap Analysis – Process, Timeline, Q&A (Megan Cook, Rod Wittler)  
* 10:50 Summarize all outstanding SIT Proposals (new, in progress) and timeline (Megan Cook)  
* 11:05 Subgroup Updates (Megan Cook)  
* 11:15 Results of Updated Coded Wire Tag Data Analysis (Jim Peterson)  
* 11:30 Science Talk: “Optimizing river flows for juvenile Chinook salmon survival: a case study” (Patti Wohner, Oregon State University). Here, we illustrate how estimates derived from monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for adaptively managing flows. Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of Chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south Delta. We then used the resulting parameter estimates to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the San Joaquin River during smolt outmigration from February–May.  
* 12:00 Adjourn
